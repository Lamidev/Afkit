## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS version recommended)
* [**npm**](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager, comes with Node.js) or [**Yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* [**MongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/) (You can install it locally, or use a cloud service like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Thisslami/Afkit.git](https://github.com/Thisslami/Afkit.git)
    cd Afkit
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Client (Frontend) directory and install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    # or if you prefer yarn:
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Navigate to the Server (Backend) directory and install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd ../server
    npm install
    # or if you prefer yarn:
    # yarn install
    ```

4.  **Set up Environment Variables:**

    * **For the Backend (`server/.env`):**
        Create a file named `.env` in the `server` directory and add the following:

        ```dotenv
        PORT=9050 # Recommended: Explicitly define the port
        NODE_ENV=development
        CLIENT_URL=[https://afkit.ng](https://afkit.ng)
        JWT_SECRET=mysecret # ‚ú® IMPORTANT: Use a strong, randomly generated secret in production!
        MONGODB_URL=mongodb+srv://akinyemioluwaseunjunior:Mikkyreel18@cluster0.zyejkwv.mongodb.net/afkit-gadgets?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
        COOKIE_DOMAIN=.afkit.ng
        COOKIE_SECURE=true
        COOKIE_SAMESITE=none
        MAILTRAP_ENDPOINT=[https://send.api.mailtrap.io/api/send](https://send.api.mailtrap.io/api/send)
        MAILTRAP_TOKEN=4e74396cbfa2f64b166eed87ca12a273
        ```

    * **For the Frontend (`client/.env`):**
        Create a file named `.env` in the `client` directory and add the following:

        ```dotenv
        VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:9050/api
        # For production, you would change this to: VITE_API_BASE_URL=[https://api.afkit.ng/api](https://api.afkit.ng/api)
        ```

---

### Running the Project

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**

    Open your terminal, navigate to the `server` directory, and run:
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm start # Or 'node server.js' if your package.json doesn't have a 'start' script
    ```
    The backend server should start on `http://localhost:9050` (or the port you specified in your `.env` file).

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**

    Open a **new terminal window**, navigate to the `client` directory, and run:
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend development server will usually open your application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

Now, your Afkit application should be fully operational in your browser!

## üì¶ Building for Production

To prepare your Afkit application for deployment to a production environment:

1.  **Build the Frontend:**

    Navigate to the `client` directory and run:
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm run build
    ```
    This command will create an optimized, minified, and production-ready build of your React application in a `dist` folder within your `client` directory.

2.  **Prepare Backend for Production:**

    * Ensure your backend `.env` variables (in the `server` directory) are configured for your production environment. This includes setting `NODE_ENV=production`, using your actual production MongoDB URI, and the correct production `CLIENT_URL`.
    * You would then typically deploy your `server` directory along with the `dist` folder generated from the frontend build to your hosting provider.

## üìè Code Style and Linting

This project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to maintain code quality and consistency.

* To run lint checks:
    ```bash
    npm run lint # Run this in your client directory
    ```
* To automatically fix lint errors (where possible):
    ```bash
    npm run lint -- --fix # Run this in your client directory
    ```
